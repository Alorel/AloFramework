# 0.2.1 (2015-05-05) #
Major bugfixes

* Fixed error where config files wouldn't be loaded correctly
* Fixed errors with the legacy Memcache getAll() alternative

Misc bugfixes

* Fixed router so it doesn't mistake an in-app ReflectionException with one that's caused by trying to initialise an invalid controller/method
* Added chdir() in index.php if it's a CLI request to be completely sure the path is correct for CLI requests.
* Debug backtrace removed from error controller
* \debug() output removed from MemcachedWrapper->getAllMemcache()

Added features

* Added an option in the router to initialise without attempting to call the controller
* __get() and __set() methods in AbstractCache
* It's now possible to get the last hash generated by AbstractDB via the getLastHash() method

Other

* PHPUNIT_RUNNING constant introduced for when you're running PHPUnit tests. This alters the automatic code flow in the sys files so they do not interfere.
* Realised that array shorthands were introduced in 5.4, not 5.3, so the framework description needs some updating...

Code style improvements

* Indentation changed in router config sample file
